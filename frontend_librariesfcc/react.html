); ReactDOM offers a simple method to render React elements to the DOM which
looks like this: ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode), where the first
argument is the React element or component that you want to render, and the
second argument is the DOM node that you want to render the component to.
ReactDOM offers a simple method to render React elements to the DOM which looks
like this: ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode), where the first
argument is the React element or component that you want to render, and the
second argument is the DOM node that you want to render the component to. As you
would expect, ReactDOM.render() must be called after the JSX element
declarations, just like how you must declare variables before using them. The
code editor has a simple JSX component. Use the ReactDOM.render() method to
render this component to the page. You can pass defined JSX elements directly in
as the first argument and use document.getElementById() to select the DOM node
to render them to. There is a div with id='challenge-node' available for you to
use. Make sure you don't change the JSX constant. const JSX = (
<div id="challenge-node">
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>Lets render this to the DOM</p>
</div>
); // Add your code below this line ReactDOM.render(JSX,
document.getElementById('challenge-node'));



Adding classes in JSXconst JSX = (
  <div className="myDiv">
    <h1>Add a class to this div</h1>
  </div>
);


there is always a closing tag in jsx we cant ignore and thus it is important to know the rules :
here are the rules :
In HTML, almost all tags have both an opening and closing tag: <div></div>; the closing tag always has a forward slash before the tag name that you are closing. However, there are special instances in HTML called void elements, or elements that don‚Äôt require both an opening and closing tag before another element can start.

For example the line-break tag can be written as <br> or as <br />, but should never be written as <br></br>, since it doesn't contain any content.

In JSX, the rules are a little different. Any JSX element can be written with a self-closing tag, and every element must be closed. The line-break tag, for example, must always be written as <br /> 
in order to be valid JSX that can be transpiled. A <div>, on the other hand, can be written as <div /> or <div></div>.
 The difference is that in the first syntax version there is no way to include anything in the <div />. 
You will see in later challenges that this syntax is useful when rendering React components.

const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h2>Welcome to React!</h2> <br/>
    <p>Be sure to close all tags!</p>
    <hr/>
  </div>
);


creating components in react js 
1 way;; statless way Defining a component in this way creates a stateless functional component. The concept of state in an application will be covered in later challenges. For now, think of a stateless component as one that can receive data and render it, but does not manage or track changes to that data. (We'll cover the second way to create a React component in the next challenge.)
const MyComponent = function() {
  // Change code below this line
return(
 <div>Hello My name is Srijan Kumar</div>
);
  // Change code above this line
}

SECOND WAY TO DEFINE THE COMPONENT:
The other way to define a React component is with the ES6 class syntax.
 In the following example, Kitten extends React.Component:

class Kitten extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hi</h1>
    );
  }
}
 in simple words :
 You're creating a React component using a class.

üß± Breakdown step-by-step:
jsx
Copy
Edit
class Kitten extends React.Component {
This creates a new component called Kitten.

It uses class syntax.

It extends React.Component, which means it's getting all the features of a React component (like rendering, state, etc.).

jsx
Copy
Edit
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
This is the constructor ‚Äì it runs when the component is created.

props = data passed to the component.

super(props) calls the constructor of the parent class (React.Component) to set up the component properly.

jsx
Copy
Edit
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hi</h1>
    );
  }
}
This is the render method ‚Äì it decides what shows up on the screen.

In this case, it just shows <h1>Hi</h1>.

üß† In short:
You're making a component named Kitten.

It displays the word ‚ÄúHi‚Äù.




class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    // Change code below this line
    return(
       <div>
       <h1>Hello React!</h1>
       </div>
    );
    // Change code above this line
  }
};


To compose these components together, you could create an App parent component which renders each of these three components as children. To render a component as a child in a React component, you include the component name written as a custom HTML tag in the JSX. For example, in the render method you could write:

return (
 <App>
  <Navbar />
  <Dashboard />
  <Footer />
 </App>
)
When React encounters a custom HTML tag that references another component (a component name wrapped in < /> like in this example), it renders the markup for that component in the location of the tag. This should illustrate the parent/child relationship between the App component and the Navbar, Dashboard, and Footer.

Rendering one component inside the other :
const ChildComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>I am the child</p>
    </div>
  );
};


class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>I am the parent</h1>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }

              <ChildComponent />
             
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};

NESTINGG THE COMPONENTS INSIDE EACH OTHER \
const TypesOfFruit = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Fruits:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Apples</li>
        <li>Blueberries</li>
        <li>Strawberries</li>
        <li>Bananas</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

const Fruits = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      { /* Change code below this line */ }
     <TypesOfFruit/>
      { /* Change code above this line */ }
    </div>
  );
};

class TypesOfFood extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Types of Food:</h1>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }         
              <Fruits/>      
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};

class Fruits extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Fruits:</h2>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
    <NonCitrus/>
    <Citrus/>
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};

class TypesOfFood extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
     super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Types of Food:</h1>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
       <Fruits/>
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
        <Vegetables />
      </div>
    );
  }
};


Render a Class Component to the DOM
You may remember using the ReactDOM API in an earlier challenge to render JSX elements to the DOM. The process for rendering React components will look very similar. The past few challenges focused on components and composition, so the rendering was done for you behind the scenes. However, none of the React code you write will render to the DOM without making a call to the ReactDOM API.

Here's a refresher on the syntax: ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode). The first argument is the React component that you want to render. The second argument is the DOM node that you want to render that component within.

React components are passed into ReactDOM.render() a little differently than JSX elements. For JSX elements, you pass in the name of the element that you want to render. However, for React components, you need to use the same syntax as if you were rendering a nested component, for example ReactDOM.render(<ComponentToRender />, targetNode). You use this syntax for both ES6 class components and functional components.

Both the Fruits and Vegetables components are defined for you behind the scenes. Render both components as children of the TypesOfFood component, then render TypesOfFood to the DOM. There is a div with id='challenge-node' available for you to use.


class TypesOfFood extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div id="challenge-node">
        <h1>TypesOfFood:</h1>
        {/* Change code below this line */}
          <Fruits/>
          <Vegetables/>
        
        {/* Change code above this line */}
      </div>
    );
  }
};

// Change code below this line
    ReactDOM.render(<TypesOfFood/>,document.getElementById('challenge-node'));


BUILDIND MY FIRST  REACT COMPONENT:
//always make sure you use camel case as js is case sensitive 

// Change code below this line
class MyComponent extends React.Component{
  constructor(props){
    super(props)}
  render(){
     return(
     <div id="challenge-node">
     <h1>My First React Component!</h1>


     </div>

     )
  }
};
ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent/>,document.getElementById('challenge-node'))

//PROPS

Props are like data you send from one component (the parent) to another (the child).

üëâ Think of it like this:

You have a parent component called Calendar

You want to give some data (like today‚Äôs date) to a child component called CurrentDate

You do that using props
You are:
Passing today‚Äôs date from Calendar ‚û°Ô∏è to CurrentDate
Displaying that date inside a <p> tag in CurrentDate

    1. Here's your child component CurrentDate:
const CurrentDate = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>The current date is: {props.date}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
2. Here's your parent component Calendar:
You need to pass the date as a prop using date={Date()}:

const Calendar = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>What date is it?</h3>
      <CurrentDate date={Date()} />
    </div>
  );
};
3. Rendering it:
ReactDOM.render(<Calendar />, document.getElementById('challenge-node'));


//final code for passing props 
const CurrentDate = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      { /* Change code below this line */ }
      <p>The current date is: {props.date}</p>
      { /* Change code above this line */ }
    </div>
  );
};

class Calendar extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>What date is it?</h3>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
        <CurrentDate date={Date()}/>
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};


//passing arrays as props :

const List = (props) => {
  { /* Change code below this line */ }
  return <p>{props.tasks.join(', ')}</p>
  { /* Change code above this line */ }
};

class ToDo extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>To Do Lists</h1>
        <h2>Today</h2>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
      <List tasks={["walk dog","workout"]}/>
        <h2>Tomorrow</h2>
        <List tasks={["walk dog","workout","eat","sleep","code","repeat"]}/>
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};


//setting up default props
const ShoppingCart = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Shopping Cart Component {props.items}</h1>
    </div>
  )
};
// Change code below this line
ShoppingCart.defaultProps ={
  items:0
};

//Override Default Props
The ability to set default props is a useful feature in React. 
The way to override the default props is to explicitly set the prop values for a component.
const Items = (props) => {
  return <h1>Current Quantity of Items in Cart: {props.quantity}</h1>
}

Items.defaultProps = {
  quantity: 0
}

class ShoppingCart extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    { /* Change code below this line */ }
    return <Items quantity={10} />
    { /* Change code above this line */ }
  }
};


<!-- Use PropTypes to Define the Props You Expect -->

 this is done in the same way as the default prop is defined :
 const Items = (props) => {
  return <h1>Current Quantity of Items in Cart: {props.quantity}</h1>
};

// Change code below this line
Items.propTypes={quantity:PropTypes.number.isRequired}
// Change code above this line

Items.defaultProps = {
  quantity: 0
};

class ShoppingCart extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return <Items />
  }
};


<!-- Access Props Using this.props -->
 <!-- for es6 component definition we use the this keyword  -->
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

  }
  render() {
    return (
        <div>
            { /* Change code below this line */ }
            <Welcome name="srijan"/>
            { /* Change code above this line */ }
        </div>
    );
  }
};

class Welcome extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

  }
  render() {
    return (
        <div>
          { /* Change code below this line */ }
          <p>Hello, <strong>{this.props.name}
          </strong>!</p>
          { /* Change code above this line */ }
        </div>
    );
  }
};


<!-- Review Using Props with Stateless Functional Components -->
const Camper=(props)=>{
   return(
     <p>{props.name}</p>
   )
}
