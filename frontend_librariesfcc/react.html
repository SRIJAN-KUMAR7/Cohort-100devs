); ReactDOM offers a simple method to render React elements to the DOM which
looks like this: ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode), where the first
argument is the React element or component that you want to render, and the
second argument is the DOM node that you want to render the component to.
ReactDOM offers a simple method to render React elements to the DOM which looks
like this: ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode), where the first
argument is the React element or component that you want to render, and the
second argument is the DOM node that you want to render the component to. As you
would expect, ReactDOM.render() must be called after the JSX element
declarations, just like how you must declare variables before using them. The
code editor has a simple JSX component. Use the ReactDOM.render() method to
render this component to the page. You can pass defined JSX elements directly in
as the first argument and use document.getElementById() to select the DOM node
to render them to. There is a div with id='challenge-node' available for you to
use. Make sure you don't change the JSX constant. const JSX = (
<div id="challenge-node">
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>Lets render this to the DOM</p>
</div>
); // Add your code below this line ReactDOM.render(JSX,
document.getElementById('challenge-node'));



Adding classes in JSXconst JSX = (
  <div className="myDiv">
    <h1>Add a class to this div</h1>
  </div>
);


there is always a closing tag in jsx we cant ignore and thus it is important to know the rules :
here are the rules :
In HTML, almost all tags have both an opening and closing tag: <div></div>; the closing tag always has a forward slash before the tag name that you are closing. However, there are special instances in HTML called void elements, or elements that don‚Äôt require both an opening and closing tag before another element can start.

For example the line-break tag can be written as <br> or as <br />, but should never be written as <br></br>, since it doesn't contain any content.

In JSX, the rules are a little different. Any JSX element can be written with a self-closing tag, and every element must be closed. The line-break tag, for example, must always be written as <br /> 
in order to be valid JSX that can be transpiled. A <div>, on the other hand, can be written as <div /> or <div></div>.
 The difference is that in the first syntax version there is no way to include anything in the <div />. 
You will see in later challenges that this syntax is useful when rendering React components.

const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h2>Welcome to React!</h2> <br/>
    <p>Be sure to close all tags!</p>
    <hr/>
  </div>
);


creating components in react js 
1 way;; statless way Defining a component in this way creates a stateless functional component. The concept of state in an application will be covered in later challenges. For now, think of a stateless component as one that can receive data and render it, but does not manage or track changes to that data. (We'll cover the second way to create a React component in the next challenge.)
const MyComponent = function() {
  // Change code below this line
return(
 <div>Hello My name is Srijan Kumar</div>
);
  // Change code above this line
}

SECOND WAY TO DEFINE THE COMPONENT:
The other way to define a React component is with the ES6 class syntax.
 In the following example, Kitten extends React.Component:

class Kitten extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hi</h1>
    );
  }
}
 in simple words :
 You're creating a React component using a class.

üß± Breakdown step-by-step:
jsx
Copy
Edit
class Kitten extends React.Component {
This creates a new component called Kitten.

It uses class syntax.

It extends React.Component, which means it's getting all the features of a React component (like rendering, state, etc.).

jsx
Copy
Edit
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
This is the constructor ‚Äì it runs when the component is created.

props = data passed to the component.

super(props) calls the constructor of the parent class (React.Component) to set up the component properly.

jsx
Copy
Edit
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hi</h1>
    );
  }
}
This is the render method ‚Äì it decides what shows up on the screen.

In this case, it just shows <h1>Hi</h1>.

üß† In short:
You're making a component named Kitten.

It displays the word ‚ÄúHi‚Äù.




class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    // Change code below this line
    return(
       <div>
       <h1>Hello React!</h1>
       </div>
    );
    // Change code above this line
  }
};


To compose these components together, you could create an App parent component which renders each of these three components as children. To render a component as a child in a React component, you include the component name written as a custom HTML tag in the JSX. For example, in the render method you could write:

return (
 <App>
  <Navbar />
  <Dashboard />
  <Footer />
 </App>
)
When React encounters a custom HTML tag that references another component (a component name wrapped in < /> like in this example), it renders the markup for that component in the location of the tag. This should illustrate the parent/child relationship between the App component and the Navbar, Dashboard, and Footer.

Rendering one component inside the other :
const ChildComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>I am the child</p>
    </div>
  );
};


class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>I am the parent</h1>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }

              <ChildComponent />
             
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};
