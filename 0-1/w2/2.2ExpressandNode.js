/* what is ECMA SCRIPT ?
what is java  SCRIPT ?
what is nodejs?
what is bun?


ECMA script --> it is a scripting language specs on which javascript is based 
                serves as the guidelines or rules for sscripting language design
                 ES6,ES6 etc

Java Script--> The implementation 
            it is the most widely used implementation of ECMA script
            BEYOND ECMASCRIPT:but js includes addditional features like DOM which is crucial 
            for web dev but not defined by ecma script
           
            compilers of javascript are ;
            1>.V8 - used by chrome /In c language 
            2>.Spider Monkey-Used by FireFox/ in c+rust

            java script primary goal --> that when we start  webbrowser then
                           we see a we page made using html css and java script



 NODE js--> when engineers and smart people thought if there is  a v8 compiler 
           which can do tasks then why cant we make  it for backend 
           like java and golang has..
        
           some smart peoplw took out the v8 engine 
           added some backend things (like file systems reads )on top of v8
           to create a new runtime to compete with BE languages like java.


          Then---> NODE.js was Developed.
