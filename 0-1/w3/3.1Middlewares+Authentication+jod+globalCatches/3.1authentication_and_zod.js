/*
What is fetch() in Middleware?
fetch() is a built-in web API (in browsers and Node.js with a polyfill or in modern versions) used to make HTTP requests â€” like calling another API. 
You can use it inside Express middleware if you want to fetch data from another server before handling a request.
